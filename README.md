    Here we present our group project developed for the <a href = "https://crl.ethz.ch/teaching/PBS23/index.html">Physically-based Simulation in Computer Graphics</a> course at ETH Zurich.  Our work involved the implementation of several key features, including position-based fluids (PBF), handling of simple static rigid body, and the generation of diffuse materials such as spray, foam, and bubbles.

## Presentation Video

## Environment Setup
To run the real time simulation, you need to install <a herf="https://www.taichi-lang.org/">Taichi</a> and <a herf="http://www.open3d.org/">Open3d</a>. The python version we use is 3.10.13.

To run the rendering, you need to install <a herf="https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/splashsurf">splashsurf</a> and <a herf="https://www.blender.org/">Blender python API </a>
## Code Usage
### Real-time Simulation
The real-time simulation provides a Taichi GGUI interface for visualization. You'll witness a dynamic scene featuring a board in motion, creating ripples as it sways back and forth while various diffuse particles (green: spray; white: foam; red: bubble) are dynamically generated. Amidst this aquatic environment, a stationary bunny stands amidst the flowing water.

The simulation process can run at 25+FPS on RTX 3070 GPU.

If your computer does not have a GPU, please change line 15 of `main.py` to `ti.init()`
```
python main.py
```
### Rendering
To prepare for rendering, follow these steps within the `main.py` file initially:

1. Set `bake_mesh = True` on line 132.
2. Specify the starting and ending frames for mesh creation on line 140.
3. Execute `main.py` until the output confirms the completion of mesh baking.

Afterward, execute `python blender_render.py` to commence image rendering. Please note that rendering the entire video sequence may require a considerable amount of time.
