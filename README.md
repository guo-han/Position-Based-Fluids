    Here we present our group project developed for the <a href = "https://crl.ethz.ch/teaching/PBS23/index.html">Physically-based Simulation in Computer Graphics</a> course at ETH Zurich.  Our work involved the implementation of several key features, including position-based fluids (PBF), handling of simple static rigid body, and generating diffuse materials such as spray, foam, and bubbles.

## Environment Setup
To run the real-time simulation, you need to install <a href="https://www.taichi-lang.org/">Taichi</a> and <a href="http://www.open3d.org/">Open3d</a>. The Python version we use is 3.10.13, the Taichi version is taichi==1.6.0, and the Open3d version is open3d==0.17.0.

To run the rendering, you need to install <a herf="https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/splashsurf">splashsurf</a> and <a herf="https://www.blender.org/">Blender python API </a>
## Code Usage
### Real-time Simulation
In this project, we built from scratch a Real-time Position-based Fluid Simulation pipeline, with advanced features like: static rigid body collision handling and diffuse particle generation (foam, spray, and bubbles). It is fully developed with the Taichi language and provides a GGUI interface for visualization. We also provide scripts to export the particle-based simulation results into mesh, and render the final scene with Blender Python APIs.

The simulation process can run at 25+FPS on RTX 3070 GPU.

If your computer does not have a GPU, please change line 15 in `main.py` to `ti.init()`
```
python main.py
```
### Rendering
To prepare for rendering, follow these steps within the `main.py` file initially:

1. Set `bake_mesh = True` on line 132.
2. Specify the starting and ending frames for mesh creation on line 140.
3. Execute `main.py` until the output confirms the completion of mesh baking.

Afterward, execute `python blender_render.py` to commence image rendering. Please note that rendering the entire video sequence may require a considerable amount of time.
